        <h1>Dear Shreya</h1>
        <h2>A Heartfelt Note</h2>
        <p>I hope you know how much I value and admire you—not just for the person you are but also for the way you
            approach life. You’ve done incredibly well, and I’m genuinely proud of how balanced and fulfilling your way
            of living is. Please know that what I’m about to share is purely my perspective, <strong>not a disagreement
                with yours.</strong></p>
        <p>I completely agree with your point that life is uncertain and that we should try to balance work, family,
            relationships, and fun. It’s valid, 100% valid. That’s exactly how life should be lived because we never
            know how things might change with time.
        </p>
        <p>But here’s where my thoughts diverge just a little. Don’t you think that, in our early career, there’s a
            small window where we need to lock in for 2-3 years and focus entirely on building the foundation of our
            late 20s, 30s, and the rest of our lives? The first such opportunity was cracking JEE. The second was during
            campus placements. And now, for the next few months, this is the phase where I feel we should give it
            everything we’ve got—our time, energy, and focus.

        </p>
        <p>Of course, balance is important, but there are times when achieving balance may not be practical. When you’re
            working toward a critical goal, like placements, GATE, or any <strong>life-changing milestone</strong>,
            sacrifices become
            necessary. People often give up sleep, nutrition, and leisure to achieve their goals. In my view, when such
            moments come—like the next 6-12 months—there’s only room to balance out the bare essentials, like sleep and
            fitness, at best. Anything beyond that can be temporarily put on hold. After all, as I’ve mentioned before,
            the efforts we put in during our early 20s <strong>compound over time.</strong> So, in those critical
            moments, should balance
            really be the priority? I don’t think so.</p>
        <p>
            Right now, we have the privilege of fewer responsibilities. I don’t have to worry much about my father’s
            health or my mother’s. I have the freedom to focus solely on my work without the weight of balancing family
            obligations. Similarly, I don’t have kids to think about or a household to manage. And Shreya, I know you
            understand this—it’s the same for you right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            But later in life, when responsibilities grow, we won’t have this freedom. For instance, right now, my
            mother needs me, but I am not there because, as you also suggested, placements are coming, so I chose not to
            go now. But in the future, I can’t do the same. I can’t be absent when my mother needs me. I can’t put down
            your calls. I can’t leave you when you need me most, like during pregnancy or any other major life event.
            Later, life won’t pause for us—but right now, it can. That’s why I believe this phase is the perfect time to
            prioritize our careers and focus on building the foundation for the future.


        </p>
        <p>
            I want to emphasize that I’m not postponing trips, fun, and adventures until our 30s or later. That’s not
            what I mean. All I’m saying is that for the next 6-7-8 months, <strong>until I sort out my finances and
                stand firmly
                on my own feet,</strong> I need to focus on working hard. After that, things will take another turn, and
            I’ll
            absolutely live a more balanced life. I’ll make time for trips, leisure, and all the things we love doing
            together.
        </p>
        <p>
            And Shreya, this applies to you too. For your GATE preparation, you need to put in the hours. You’ve already
            done exceptionally well by cracking your placement, and you’ve <strong>earned</strong> the last couple of
            months of relaxation and fun. But I’d like to ask you—are you truly enjoying this downtime? Or is there a
            part of you that feels you could be doing more right now? Give it a thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            In trying to find balance and room for fun and trips right now, don’t you think we should be cautious that
            it doesn’t lead to a future where balance doesn’t even become a possibility? Shouldn’t we aim for a future
            where balance truly becomes an option?
        </p>
        <p>
            All I want is for both of us to use this time wisely, to work hard now so that we can create a future where
            we won’t have any regrets about the choices we made in our early 20s. I know it’s tough, but I also know
            that we’re capable of making it through this phase together. And when the time comes, I promise you, we’ll
            celebrate every bit of our success—together.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">Yours always,<br>Shubham &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
